# VoteNow

VoteNow is my solution to a freeCodeCamp full stack project challenge, Build a Voting app. It allows users to browse existing polls and to sign up and login to vote or create new polls. The app's responsive design delivers a clear and professional layout when accessed from all type of devices.

## Required user stories:
* As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
* As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
* As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with up to six (6) possible options.
* As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
* As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. 

## Tech stack and key packages:
* This application uses a **MERN stack** of **React** + **Node** + **Express** + **MongoDB**. 
* Other packages include **Bcrypt**, **React-Router**, and **Bootstrap**. 
* The interactive pie chart showing poll statistics is created with **Chart.js**.
